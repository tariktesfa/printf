## General Requirement

- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples.Use them to test the functions, but don‚Äôt have to push them to the repo (if you do we won‚Äôt take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples.
- The prototypes of all the functions should be included in the header file called main.h
- Don‚Äôt forget to push the header file
- All your header files should be include guarded
- Note that we will not provide the _putchar function for this project
### Test
